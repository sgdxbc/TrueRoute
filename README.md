**TrueRoute is an implementation of *FlowSifter*<sup>[1]</sup> in Python.**

Developed with Python 3.10.5, but should work on many recent versions.

**Sanity check.** Run `python -m unittest`. ![Workflow status](https://github.com/sgdxbc/TrueRoute/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)

**About name**. Simple analogy. Process flow stream as galgame gameplay. Counting states as characters' favorability, which go up and down on different conditions, and decide important branching base on instant values. Finally, a successfully processing would be entering true route.
