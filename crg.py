crg.py: Counting Regular Grammars implementation
(subtitle: how to write Python like SQL)

The main interface is `optimize(grammar, extraction_grammar)`, which do all 
required transformation from a frontend context free grammar to CRG.

`grammar` and `extraction_grammar` has the same representation, which is a tuple
of `ProductionRule`. The constructing arguments of `ProductionRule` and related
`RuleItem` are asserted in `__init__`. For `extraction_grammar` it must also
follow grammar convention, which is nonempty, and the first rule's head must be
start symbol. For `grammar` there is no such requirement since it does not 
define start symbol.

The `guard` argument is a dict whose key is variable identifier, and value is 
2-tuple (low, high), to declare a `low <= variable < high` guard. One of 
low/high bound may be `None` if it's a single side guard. Some example:
{x: (0, 1)} -> x == 0
{x: (1, None)} -> x >= 1, or x > 0 (the two are equal for integer x)
{x: (1, None), y: (None, 1)} -> x > 0 && y < 1
{} -> always true
(TODO: variable as bound?)

(TODO: define `action` representation)

The result of `optimize` is a generator of CRG rules, i.e. 6-tuple
(source state, guard, priority, regular, action, target state). Each state is an 
nonterminal symbol in CRG and is also a state in CA. Initial state is the first 
generated one. The `None` target state is the accepted one.

Notice that the rules produced by `optimize` is "nondeterministic", thus cannot
be directly executed in a pratical way. To be specific, at a time a subset of
rules of a source state may be enabled by current counter values. One possible
work flow is to postprocess the rule list with `gen.relevant`, which is the way 
adpoted by cli's `ca` command. See `gen` module document in advance.
